        <h2>GST Benefits/Advantages</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> GST is a unified, destination based indirect tax. Such a tax is imposed on the value added to goods as well as services at each stage of the supply chain. The purpose behind implementing GST is to create a unified market in the country. So, a host of taxes are subsumed and the tax compliance is reduced to achieve such a purpose.Thus, 17 Centre and State levies such as excise duty, service tax, VAT, Central Sales Tax etc. are consolidated.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"> Needless to say, GST is certainly one of the path breaking tax reforms of India.  In fact, the interim finance minister Mr. Piyush Goyal was positive about GST revenue collection during the Interim Budget 2019. He said that the GST revenues have been upbeat. This was despite the major GST rate reductions.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">For instance, the total gross GST revenue collected in the month of January, 2019 is Rs 1,02,503 crore. Now, this is the third time that GST Revenue collection has crossed one lakh crore mark in financial year 2018-2019. In addition to this, the total number of GSTR 3B Returns filed for the month of December up to 31st January, 2019 is 73.3lakh.</p>
