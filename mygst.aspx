       <p class="text-justify"><b>GST</b> is the biggest tax-related reform in the country bringing uniformity in the taxation structure and eliminating the cascading of taxes that was levied in the past. The GST Council meets from time to time to revise the GST rates for various products. Several states and industries recommend reduction in GST tax rate for various items which are discussed in these meetings. </p>
        <p class="text-justify">Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the government wanted to keep the GST rates close to the original rates. But there were differences in case of some items because of the changes in the economy as well as customer preferences. Some commodities were kept in the high tax bracket (18-28%) but on scrutinizing the list, they found that these commodities should be considered as necessities and not luxuries. This is why the GST rates were revised for commodities such as notebooks, exercise books, spectacles and lenses and some other items.</p>
        <br />        <br />
        <b>GST Tax Rates on some common items:</b>

        <p class="text-justify"><b>05%-</b>Household necessities such as edible oil, sugar, spices, tea, and coffee (except instant) are included. Coal , Mishti/Mithai (Indian Sweets) and Life-saving drugs are also covered under this GST slab.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>12%-</b>This includes computers and processed food.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>18%-</b>Hair oil, toothpaste and soaps, capital goods and industrial intermediaries are covered in this slab.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>28%-</b>Luxury items such as small cars , consumer durables like AC and Refrigerators, premium cars, cigarettes and aerated drinks , High-end motorcycles  are included here.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-justify">Though edible items like sugar, tea and coffee are included in the 5% slab, milk does not attract any tax under the new GST regime. The idea behind this is to ensure that basic food items are available for everyone but instant food is kept out of this category.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"> - Basic household items like toothpaste and hair oil, which currently attract 28% tax, will be taxed at 18% only.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"> - Sweets will also be taxable at 5%.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"> - Tax rates on coal has also been reduced from 11.69% to just 5% in order to relieve the pressure on power industries.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"> - GST also gives a major push to domestic industries as they will be able to procure seamless input credit for capital goods. Make in India campaign is set to flourish after this reform.</p>
        <br />
        <h4>GST Rates on Goods</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">The government has proposed a 4-tier tax structure for all goods and services under the slabs- 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.

        <ul><b>GST on Loans and Advances</b></ul>
        <p class="text-justify">Earlier Service Tax was levied on Loans which has now been replaced by GST which would now be levied on loans. The rate of Service Tax was 15% whereas the rate of GST is 18%. A lot of people are of the opinion that the effective cost of having a loan would increase as the rate of GST is 3% higher than the rate of Service Tax. Several people are of the opinion that their EMI’s would increase as the rate has been increased by 3%. However, this is not the case as GST is not levied on repayment of loan or on payment of Interest on Loan.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"> GST is only levied on the processing charges and any other charges paid to the bank excluding the principal repayment and interest payment. These other charges include the Loan Processing Fees, Loan Prepayment Charges and other charges, if any. As a major chunk of the loan repayment comprises of principal repayment and interest payment, the impact of GST on Loans would be very negligible. The impact of GST on Home Loans and Personal Loans has been explained below for a much better understanding of the impact. </p>
        <p class="text-justify"> Mentioned below are the important loans and their GST rates: </p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">  (a) Personal Loan– <b>18%</b> </p>
        <p class="text-justify">  (b) Home Loans– <b>18%</b></p>
        <p class="text-justify">  (c) Car Loan– <b>18%</b></p>
        <br />
        <ul><b>GST on Cars</b></ul>
        <p class="text-justify"> Subsequent to bringing cars under the GST regime, the GST rate on cars has been fixed at 28% for all personal use vehicles featuring a petrol or diesel driven engine. However, in addition to GST, a composition cess is also applicable to cars over and above the GST Rate. Thus the overall tax rate applicable to vehicles under GST ranges from 29% to 50%. Lower rates of taxation are however applicable to cars driven by cleaner technologies such as fuel cells (including hydrogen fuel cell) and electric vehicles. </p>
        <br />
        <ul><b>GST on Gold</b></ul>
        <p class="text-justify"> Subsequent to introduction of GST on items made from gold such as gold jewelry, the current GST rate on gold is 3%. However, a 5% GST rate is applicable to making charges applied to gold jewelry in case the manufacturing is outsourced to a job worker. This can however, be charged as input tax credit (ITC) by the jeweler and only a 3% GST charge is applied to the final bill paid by the purchaser of gold jewelry items. Know more about GST on Gold and impact of GST on the gold industry </p>
        <br />
        <ul><b>GST On Real Estate</b></ul>
        <p class="text-justify"> GST is applicable to real estate purchases only if you are purchasing an under construction property. The GST rate applicable to such commercial or residential transactions is 12% till 31st March 2019. From 1st April, the applicable GST Rates on residential real estate will be 5% for non-affordable housing properties and 1% for affordable housing properties. No GST is applicable in case you are purchasing a ready to move in property. Additionally, different GST rates are applicable to various building materials used in the construction of houses/flats. This can range from 5% (sand, marble rubble, etc.) to 28% (cement, etc.). </p>
        <br />  
        <ul><b>GST on Food</b></ul>
        <p class="text-justify">Food items especially fresh food mostly carry a Nil GST rate. However, packaged food stuff and semi-processed/processed foods do feature GST rates starting from 5% up to 18%. While no food stuff are currently included in the highest 28% GST bracket, the 18% rate of GST is applicable to some common food products such as chocolates as well as baked goods such as cakes.  </p>
        
       <ul><b>Upcoming products in GST Rates Slab  </b></ul>
        <p class="text-justify"> The Government is going on with some new tactics to bring in some of the products under GST system. As hinted by Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, there could be an inclusion of products under GST with the reduction of GST rates on some products.  Major products which can come under GST rates slab includes : </p>
